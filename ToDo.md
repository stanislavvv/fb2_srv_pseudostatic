# To Do

- send file as `text/html` from static struct, return 404, if not in struct (as ../../../etc/passwd)
- single place for '/opds/authors/', '/opds/sequence/', '/opds/genres/' links place
- multiple pass over `.list` for lower peak memory consumption (no OOM on Orange PI)

# FIX

- use genres replacement when generating indexes
- pagination in genre book lists
