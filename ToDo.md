# To Do

- input sanitizing (../ and other)
- single place for '/opds/authors/', '/opds/sequence/', '/opds/genres/' links place (code refinement)
- description html refinement (via BeautifulSoap)

# FIX

- use genres replacement when generating indexes
- case-insensitive sort in book/author/sequence/genre lists
