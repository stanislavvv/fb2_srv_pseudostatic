# To Do

- single place for '/opds/authors/', '/opds/sequence/', '/opds/genres/' links place (code refinement)
- search several words. If search in book titles - add search by publish year (or, not and)

# FIX

- use genres replacement when generating indexes
- case-insensitive sort in book/author/sequence/genre lists -- need testing
- year always null in publish info
